    <h2>Create new Part Number</h2>

    <p>Create a new part number in the repository. The product code (the 5 digit number after the dash) should be
        generated automatically, so the field is greyed out here. If you need to designate a specific product code, for
        example when generating multiple part-types for a single part, use the slider to unlock the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user should check that the specific product code is unique ahead of assigning it. Even if the code used is
        valid for this part type, it may already be in use for another part type. You can use the Unique utility in the
        navigation bar to check that a specific 5 digit value is unique across all parts.
    </p>
    <p> Otherwise, this should be left blank and the next available unique product code will be assigned.</p>
