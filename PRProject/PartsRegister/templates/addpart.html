    <h2>Create new Part Number</h2>

    <p>Create a new part number in the repository. The identity number (the 5 digit number after the dash) can be
        automatically generated. If you only require a single part number, leave this value blank. If you need to
        designate a specific product code (for example when generating multiple part-types for a single part) you can
        supply a unique value here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user should check that the specific product code is unique ahead of assigning it. Even if the code used is
        valid for this part type, it may already be in use for another part type. You can use the Unique utility in the
        navigation bar to find the next unique value across all part types.
